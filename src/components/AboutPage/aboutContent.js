    para_1:
        `Hi,I am Jing. I am from Taiwan and had been living in Australia for more than 7 years.
    I was a chef , a sucessful sales man , a backpacker and had served in army special force.
    And now I am a Web Developer. My life is always full of chellenges and I really really enjoy it. `,
    para_2: `As a Web Developer, I am more familiar with javascript ,React for frontend and Node as backend service. But not limit to that ,I am still a big fan using google firebase/firsestore 
    still learning any new feature and web tech. And I have a bunch of interesting courses on my waiting list on Udemy and Youtube. I am a self motivated person.
    So let's see what can I help.`,
    para_3: `YOU NEED A WEBSITE! 
    Do I need a website? a lot of people asked. Yes. You definitely need. A modern Website is not only
    help you to display you products but also can schedule your timeshift. And not just a big company need a website. I would say 
    a small business needs a website more. Because your shop or home studio is probaly not located in a gold place. But you can 
    provide a very good service or you sell very unique product. You need a site to promote and sell you service/products. I
    can help you that! 
    `,
    para_4: `Let's face some fact here. I was a head chef in several restaurants. When home delivery-service rises like Uber-eat. I witness 
    lots of restaurants closed in a few months . Why? let's do some math. Uber-eat charge you 30 to 35% and your food cost about 25% ,tax
     takes 10% and if you are a franchise, 10% more. 55% gone before you sell that meal and that's not included you labor ,rent and bills.
     And the worst part is that as a customer you are always just a one shop in a huge online food court. 
     I saw a few shop they start doing they owned delivery. They pay a fixed cost to a driver and charge customers delivery fee. You 
     get a win-win. But before that you need a website to provide online ordering and steadily promote you business.`,
    para_5: `Well,that's a lot. But that's my observation. So if you are considering to start your business or you
    already have one but in stuggle. I can help you. If you have a project need someone to join your team. I am available.
     If you are generrous employer and looking for an employee who are eager to learn more and always being honest. I am the one!
     So contat me. I wish you all the best.`
