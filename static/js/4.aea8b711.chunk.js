I am from Taiwan and had been living in Australia for more than 7 years.\n    I was a chef , a sucessful sales man , a backpacker and had served in army special force.\n    And now I am a Web Developer. My life is always full of chellenges and I really really enjoy it. ",u="As a Web Developer, I am more familiar with javascript ,React for frontend and Node as backend service. But not limit to that ,I am still a big fan using google firebase/firsestore \n    still learning any new feature and web tech. And I have a bunch of interesting courses on my waiting list on Udemy and Youtube. I am a self motivated person.\n    So let's see what I can help.",d="YOU NEED A WEBSITE! \n    Do I need a website? a lot of people asked. Yes. You definitely need. A modern Website is not only\n    help you to display you products but also can schedule your timeshift. And not just a big company need a website. I would say \n    a small business needs a website more. Because your shop or home studio is probaly not located in a gold place. But you can \n    provide a very good service or you sell very unique product. You need a site to promote and sell you service/products. I\n    can help you that! \n    ",c="Let's face some fact here. I was a head chef in several restaurants. When home delivery-service rises like Uber-eat. I witness \n    lots of restaurants closed in a few months . Why? let's do some math. Uber-eat charge you 30 to 35% and your food cost about 25% ,tax\n     takes 10% and if you are a franchise, 10% more. 55% gone before you sell that meal and that's not included you labor ,rent and bills.\n     And the worst part is that on customer side you are always just one shop in a huge online food court. \n     I saw a few shop they start doing their owned delivery service. They pay a fixed cost to a driver and charge customers delivery fee. You \n     get a win-win. But before that you need a website to provide online ordering and steadily promote you business.",m="Well,that's a lot. But that's my observation. So if you are considering to start your business or you\n    already have one but in stuggle. I can help you. If you have a project need someone to join your team. I am available.\n     If you are generrous employer and looking for an employee who are eager to learn more and always being honest. I am the one!\n     So contat me.
